# Simple-Shell
Unix simple shell program in C.
Objectives:
1. Familiarity with system calls in Unix environment.
2. Introducing processes and their nesting.
# Problem Statement:
It is required to implement a Unix shell program. A shell is simply a program that
conveniently allows you to run other programs. Read up on your favorite shell to see what it
does. Your shell must support the following:
1. The internal shell command "exit" which terminates the shell
• Concepts: shell commands, exiting the shell.
• System calls: exit()
2. A command with no arguments
• Example: ls, cp, rm ...etc
• Details: Your shell must block until the command completes and, if the return
code is abnormal, print out a message to that effect.
• Concepts: Forking a child process, waiting for it to complete and synchronous
execution.
• System calls: fork(), execvp(), exit(), wait()
3. A command with arguments
• Example: ls –l
• Details: Argument 0 is the name of the command.
• Concepts: Command-line parameters.
4. A command, with or without arguments, executed in the background using &.
a. Example: firefox &
b. Details: In this case, your shell must execute the command and return
immediately, not blocking until the command finishes.
c. Concepts: Background execution, signals, signal handlers, processes and
asynchronous execution.
d. Requirements: You have to show that the opened process will be nested as a
child process to the shell program via opening the task manager found in the
operating system like in Figure 1. Additionally you have to write in a log file
when a child process is terminated (main application will be interrupted by a
SIGCHLD signal). So you have to implement an interrupt handler to handle
this interrupt and do the corresponding action to it.
